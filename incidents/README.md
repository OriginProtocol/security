# Context
As maintainers of the OUSD protocol, we find value in analyzing attacks on other Defi protocols to
  - ensure OUSD is not at risk of a similar attack
  - continuously educate our team on smart contract security 
  - spread the knowledge by making those analysis public and sharing them with the rest of the community
We decided to setup a rotation in our engineering team to analyze the latest hacks that come up.

# Process
 - The responsibility involves writing a short write-up of the hack with technical details and whether or not OUSD is at risk of a similar attack.
 - This should happen shortly after an attack, ideally within 24 hours.
 - While the rotation designates an engineer responsible for driving the analysis, it does not mean this engineer is on their own to figure it all out. It should be a learning experience where asking questions and getting help from the rest of the team is expected.
 - It is impossible to predict when the next hack will occur. An engineer who is next on the rotation may be OOO when a hack happens. In that case, we can simply have the next person on the list, or anyone who wants to volunteer, trade their spot with them.
