# 2021-5-25 Merlin Attack

_Daniel Von Fange_

## What happened

Attackers stole $680K from Merlin LP holders on May 26th, 2021 via a bug in the logic for minting rewards tokens. 

## How it works

Imagine a robot bank.

This robot bank doubles any interest by earned depositors. When you go to collect, three robots assist you. The first robot looks up how much interest you have earned since your last visit. The second robot fetches that amount from the vault and places it on the desk of the third robot, who doubles the amount on his desk and hands it to you.

But what if, just before you went through the line to collect a little interest, you threw a stack of money onto the third robot's desk. Totally legal to give robots money, right? When you went through the line to collect a trillionth of a cent of interest earned, that last robot would double your large stack of money as well as your tiny amount of earned interest.

Repeat until you have drained the bank.

### The Merlin Attack

The actual Merlin rewards process was almost as simple as that hypothetical example. It would:

- Collect the CAKE the user had earned to the contract.
- Mint MERL to the user **based on the amount of CAKE now held by the rewards contract**.
- Transfer 30% of the CAKE as a fee to the Merlin system.
- Send the user all remaining CAKE in the contract.

The attacker exploited this by directly sending CAKE to the rewards contract before  requesting rewards on a tiny deposit.

At the time of the attack, CAKE was trading for approximately $17 and MERL was trading at $49, which made this very profitable. The attacker's first time looping through the process spent about $918 worth of CAKE for a gain of $4,900 worth of MERL.

Each time the attacker sold the MERL that was minted to them, the loop profitability would reduce sightly. Eventually, the price of MERL was crashed to a point where the attack was no longer profitable to continue.

## What allowed this to happen?

This attack happened because the contract tried to calculate how much the user had earned using the current balance of the rewards contract. The correct way to calculate this number would have been to compare the balance before the withdrawal of CAKE with the balance after the withdraw.

This is a scary class of errors because these are not going to show up on unit tests, fuzzing tests, or formal verification, unless those tests are specifically written to probe this specific vulnerability. Math in the contract's functionality will appears to work correctly up until the contract is attacked. This vulnerability class is also not in any of the "standard" set of common solidity problems checked by automated tools.

Any time balanceOf() is in contract code, it is important to see if that value could be manipulated by an attacker, and what the consequences would be.

## Are we vulnerable?

No. OUSD does not mint rewards tokens, nor does it do calculations based on balances which the user can recover.
