# DODO

Dodo was hacked for $2 million using a combination of fake token attack and missing a check that initialize on a contract can only be called once. This attack affected only V2 pools namely: WSZO, WCRES, ETHA, and FUSI pool.

## Technical Description

The source of the problem is that these lines were missing in the [init](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/commit/01c544780291a5acc3e2be4980493e63065fb200#diff-338291e7d47bd3ae0f13396fa01e412005b9dc2c64e53800bb3d6c9b6e373820R34-R36) function that would prevent the init function to be called multiple times. Attacker exploited the missing check init check to bypass the flashLoan function balance check and drain the pool.

The attack was achieved with the following steps: 

- Exploiter creates a counterfeit token and initialize the smart contract with it by calling the [init](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/blob/8b683af08f645c30e2b12d2e0cde38f08236f135/contracts/DODOVendingMachine/impl/DVM.sol#L24) function.
- Exploiter calls the [sync](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/blob/01c544780291a5acc3e2be4980493e63065fb200/contracts/DODOVendingMachine/impl/DVMVault.sol#L74-L86) function and sets the `reserve` variable, which represents the token balance, to 0.
- Exploiter calls init again to re-initialize - this time with a “real” token (i.e. tokens in DODO’s pools)
- Exploiter uses a [flash loan](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/blob/01c544780291a5acc3e2be4980493e63065fb200/contracts/DODOVendingMachine/impl/DVMTrader.sol#L89) to transfer all real tokens from the pools and bypass the [flash loan check](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/blob/01c544780291a5acc3e2be4980493e63065fb200/contracts/DODOVendingMachine/impl/DVMTrader.sol#L105-L108)

The reason that flash loan check failed to perform its intended task was because the reserve balances were set to 0 even though the pool had a large amount of the reserve token.

## Possible fixes
- obviously adding the [init](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/commit/01c544780291a5acc3e2be4980493e63065fb200#diff-338291e7d47bd3ae0f13396fa01e412005b9dc2c64e53800bb3d6c9b6e373820R34-R36) check to prevent multiple pool initialisation
- some defensive programming where [sync](https://github.com/DODOEX/contractV2/blob/01c544780291a5acc3e2be4980493e63065fb200/contracts/DODOVendingMachine/impl/DVMVault.sol#L74-L86) would be called inside the init function


## Commentary

OUSD is not vulnerable to this sort of attack because of the [initializer modifier](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/blob/master/contracts/contracts/vault/VaultInitializer.sol#L15) that prevent initialize being called multiple times
