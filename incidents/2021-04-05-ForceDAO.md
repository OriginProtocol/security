# ForceDAO

ForceDAOwas hacked. A total of 183 ETH worth of FORCE tokens were taken, but there was about 14.8 million FORCE tokens that were at risk which the initial attacker returned(they labeled him the whitehat attacker).


## Technical Description

The source of the problem is that the transfer call to the FORCE token in the deposit call of their xFORCE token(their reward token) did not validate the return value. It assumed that the transfer in FORCE will revert on failure and it didn't. The github is no longer online, but here's a screenshot of the deposit function [unprotected transfer](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EyHjWJEWYAMK5QZ.jpg:large).

### The attack was achieved with the following steps:

- call to deposit to mint xFORCE token and transfer them [deposit](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7242f477547df9f2692c80d5a33ebf95fa6f13d5e0e15ed6dd90574ea2c7c5e3).
- withdraw minted xFORCE tokens as FORCE tokens [withdraw](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x09ebdd2121bf4e364cc30071bbf63ab2e8a229f11a5488fbe6b472f17a88ebe0).
- transfer tokens to exchange(whitehat attacker sent the tokens back to FORCE's multisig wallet)

This is the the address of the [whitehat attacker](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf88a427c5bf29acf58497c0088cbf7ca9836b7b2#tokentxns)


## Possible fixes
- use safeTransfer and SafeERC20 for all token functions


## Commentary

Force mentioned in their [write up](https://blog.forcedao.com/xforce-exploit-post-mortem-7fa9dcba2ac3) that they forked sushi for their xForce implementation and forked Aragon Minime for their token implmenetation, but both of these were still within their code base. A security audir or even having a negative unit tests would have revealed the issue. OUSD does not seem to be at risk, we do have some naked transfer functions in cryptic and flipper but we make use of their return value.
